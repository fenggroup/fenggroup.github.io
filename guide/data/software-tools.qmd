Members of the group are expected to use the software tools listed below to generate research products. 

### Programming language

The group primarily use Python for day-to-day work such as scientific computing, data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, and developing computational models. 

### Data visualization 

- The group primarily uses the Python library [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) for data visualization.
- In rare cases in which Altair does not serve our needs, we use [D3.js](https://d3js.org) for bespoke data visualization.

### Scientific writing

- For day-to-day work the group primarily uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) to write reports, slides, etc.
- For manuscripts (journals, conferences, dissertations, thesis) in which Quarto is not fully capable yet, we use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org).

### Version control

The group has an organization account on GitHub for version control <https://github.com/fenggroup>

Group members are expected to use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. 
Create an account on GitHub if do not have one already, and request group membership.

### Slides

- In most cases slides should be written in [Quarto slides](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/) using the group's poster template (to be added).

### Research poster

A research poster should be written in LaTeX using the group's [poster template](https://github.com/fenggroup/gemini-umich).

### PhD proposal & dissertation

PhD proposal and dissertation should be written in LaTeX using (unofficial) the University of Michigan [dissertation template](https://github.com/meluso/UMich_Dissertation_Template).

### Masters' thesis

Masters' thesis should be written in LaTeX using (unofficial) the University of Michigan [dissertation template](https://github.com/meluso/UMich_Dissertation_Template).

### Diagrams

In most cases use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for generating diagrams such as flowcharts.
Note [Mermaid diagrams can be directly created in a Quarto document](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html#mermaid). 

### Image editing

Use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) which is a free and open-source image editor.

### Video editing

Use [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org) which is a free and open-source video editor.
