# Research bicycle with lidar

We have developed a research bicycle outfitted with a [lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) (Ouster OS1-128). 
The lidar on the bicycle is able to continuously measure the 3D environment in point clouds,
which are made up of hundreds of thousand of data points in a 3-dimensional space.

This lidar bicycle allows us to study driver-bicyclist interactions in real-world roadways with continuous and accurate distance measurements from the bicycle to any nearby objects (e.g., surrounding vehicles). 
This, in turn, helps us to better understand the safety implications (e.g., driver passing distance when overtaking cyclists) of various real-world street environment and bicycle facility designs. 

<!-- FOR FUTURE: Describe why studying driver-bicyclist interaction can help us. -->

## Interactive point cloud visualization

You can interact with the point clouds recorded from our lidar bicycle in the embedded window below.
Try using a mouse or touch pad (if you are using a computer) or your fingers (if you are using a touchscreen device) to rotate the view and zoom in/out. 
You can also open the embedded window in full screen by [clicking here](https://fenggroup.org/pointcloud/examples/bike-2.html).

## Open data repository

We have developed an [open data repository](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/cwd085i7kb1kek6b1vwgb/AJGd-YTjFgouH9MSV4mVHxg?rlkey=qmtywmpwvrh6aun7b9ldht4sd&st=92eg5tbr&dl=0) to share the data that were collected by our lidar bike.
It includes the synchronized lidar data and camera data at 10 Hz with timestamps.
If you are interested in exploring the data, start with the `README.md` file located in the root directory of the repository (linked above). 
For any questions or issues regarding the repository please email Dr. Fred Feng at <fredfeng@umich.edu>.
